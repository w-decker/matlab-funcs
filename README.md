This repository is for learning how to build functions in MATLAB ranging in complexities. The code in this lesson makes use of Jupyter Lab/Notebook and the MATLAB kernel. Instructions for installation can be found [here](https://github.com/mathworks/jupyter-matlab-proxy). This is not a requirement and you may toggle between whichever IDE you wish to use.  

I have also included the raw MATLAB code in the file [matlab code](/matlabcode) which does not inlcude any of the markdown text that you'll find in Jupyter Notebook files.

| [Introduction](/introduction-to-functions.ipynb) | What is a function? Why might you need to create your own? The basic structure of custom functions. |
| [Customizing Functions](/customizing-functions.ipynb) | How can we scaffold simple functions into more complex functions using `varargin`, `nargin`, and `switch case`? |
| [Arguments](/arguments.ipynb) | How to use the `arguments end` statement and why this helps your code with an example using single value decomposition (SVD). |
