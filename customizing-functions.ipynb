When calling the function we want to add the string/char `'abs'` to the end of the function inputs if we wish to find the sum of the absolute values of our input , which would look like this: `mySum(-6, 'abs')`. Then we begin `switch`. Here we say that the sign (either positive or negative) of `a` is our \"switch expression\". We take this expression and test it agains each case. If it satisifes the case, it executes the code belonging to that case. I have included `otherwise` to tell the function, \"if `a` is not negative, then keep it that way.\" This is essentially how `switch case` logic works. This is repeated if there is more than one input, like `mySum(1, 2, -12, 'abs')`. \n",

    "`switch case` is probably not the most effective method in this particular case, but it has it's uses. If you are working a lot with string/char input arguments, then `switch case` is the method you are going to use, as you do not need to ensure that user input arguments into a function in a specific order. \n",
