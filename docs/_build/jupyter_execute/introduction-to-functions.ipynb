Custom functions, which I will be teaching here, are especially helpful if you plan on executing lots of repeated code. `mean()` and `heatmap()` are both functions, for example. When you execute a function, you are \"calling\" it and executing the code embedded within it.\n",

    "### Futher details about building functions. \n",

    "There are a few important practices to be aware of when making functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Typically, functions are created in seperate MATLAB files. You can create a function script by clicking New >> Function. This opens a template for your function which looks something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function [outputArg1,outputArg2] = untitled4(inputArg1,inputArg2)\n",
    "%UNTITLED4 Summary of this function goes here\n",
    "%   Detailed explanation goes here\n",
    "outputArg1 = inputArg1;\n",
    "outputArg2 = inputArg2;\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you are creating a function _locally_, meaning within your script and not in a separate file, then the function or functions must be created at the **end** of the script. It is alright if you call the functions earlier--this is just a rule in MATLAB. If you create your function and then attempt to call it after you have created it, you will receive this error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Function definitions in a script must appear at the end of the file.\n",
    "Move all statements after the \"mySum\" function definition to before the first local function\n",
    "definition.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functions _should_ contain a docstring or an explanation of the function's implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some of these key points."
